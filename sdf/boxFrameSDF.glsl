    A list of useful distance function to simple primitives. All
    these functions (except for ellipsoid) return an exact
    euclidean distance, meaning they produce a better SDF than
    what you'd get if you were constructing them from boolean
    operations (such as cutting an infinite cylinder with two planes).
